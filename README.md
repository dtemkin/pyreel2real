<b>Review Ratings</b>
###############
<em>My analysis of whether the star ratings assigned by movie review critics differed from the overall sentiment conveyed in the written portion of the review. Data used was collected from IMDB and RogerEbert.com. AlchemyAPI was used for the text sentiment estimation.

The script is compatible with both a direct connection to AlchemiAPI through IBM Watson or through Mashape. Both are free but there are daily query limits imposed on Free User Accounts. For more information please refer to http://www.alchemyapi.com/api.

A more complete description of the project can be found on my blog: www.dtemkin.com/star_rating_bias </em>
